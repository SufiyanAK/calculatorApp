# Calculator Web App

## üöÄ Project Overview

Greetings to the Calculator Web App! This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient calculator for everyday arithmetic needs. The calculator is crafted to be user-friendly, featuring a neat interface that supports both light and dark modes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

Let's talk about how we've set things up:

- **index.html:** This is where we define the structure of our calculator interface.
- **style.css:** Here lies the magic of styling ‚Äì making our calculator look good, with options for both light and dark modes.
- **script.js:** Our JavaScript file is where we've poured in the logic for our calculator to function smoothly.

## üåü Features

Here's what our calculator brings to the table:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** From addition and subtraction to multiplication and division, it's got you covered.
- **Error Handling:** We keep things clear with a display that shows "Error" for invalid expressions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes based on your preference.
- **Responsive Design:** No matter the device ‚Äì desktop or mobile ‚Äì our calculator adapts for a seamless user experience.

## üîß Suggestions and Improvements

While our calculator does its job well, there's always room for improvement. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Expression Parsing:**
   - Utilize a custom `customEval` function for improved security instead of using `eval()`.

2. **Operator Logic Enhancement:**
   - Improve operator handling logic for better consistency.

3. **Reset Button Logic:**
   - Adjust the logic for handling the "Reset" button to improve clarity.

4. **Unit Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of individual functions and catch potential bugs early.

## üîÑ Code Updates

### **`script.js`:**

1. **Expression Parsing:**
   - **Update:** Introduced a custom `customEval` function for better security in evaluating expressions. Replaced the use of `eval()`.

2. **Code Organization:**
   - **Update:** Created a separate `calculateResult` function for improved code organization.

3. **Operator Logic Enhancement:**
   - **Update:** Improved operator handling logic for better consistency.

Feel free to jump in with your ideas and contributions! We're all ears and value the input of our fellow developers.
