# Calculator Web App

## üöÄ Project Overview

Greetings to the Calculator Web App! This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient calculator for everyday arithmetic needs. The calculator is crafted to be user-friendly, featuring a neat interface that supports both light and dark modes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

Let's talk about how we've set things up:

- **index.html:** This is where we define the structure of our calculator interface.
- **style.css:** Here lies the magic of styling ‚Äì making our calculator look good, with options for both light and dark modes.
- **script.js:** Our JavaScript file is where we've poured in the logic for our calculator to function smoothly.

## üåü Features

Here's what our calculator brings to the table:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** From addition and subtraction to multiplication and division, it's got you covered.
- **Error Handling:** We keep things clear with a display that shows "Error" for invalid expressions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes based on your preference.
- **Responsive Design:** No matter the device ‚Äì desktop or mobile ‚Äì our calculator adapts for a seamless user experience.

## üîß Suggestions and Improvements

While our calculator does its job well, there's always room for improvement. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Expression Parsing:**
   - Think about creating a custom expression parser rather than using `eval()` for better security.

2. **Code Optimization:**
   - To keep things snappy, consider storing the reference to the input box in a variable to avoid redundant DOM queries.

3. **Enhance Operator Logic:**
   - Fine-tune how operators are handled to cover additional scenarios for consistent behavior.

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Spice things up by providing visual feedback for button clicks, like highlighting the pressed button for a better user experience.

5. **Unit Testing:**
   - Add some unit tests to make sure each function is doing its job and catch potential bugs early.

Feel free to jump in with your ideas and contributions! We're all ears and value the input of our fellow developers.
